JobFinder 🚀

JobFinder is an automated job discovery and notification system. It scrapes job listings from RSS feeds, processes them using JavaScript, stores them in a PostgreSQL database via **Spring Boot**, and sends notifications through automated workflows powered by n8n.

This project is designed for efficiency, scalability, and easy extensibility.

Workflow Steps: 
1. Schedule Trigger – Runs every day at 9 AM  
2. RSS Read – Fetches jobs from configured RSS feeds  
3. Code in JavaScript – Cleans, parses, and extracts data (salary, categories, description)  
4. HTTP Request – Sends job data to Spring Boot backend API  
5. Send a text message – Sends job notification via Telegram  

> ⚠️ All sensitive credentials like Telegram chat ID or backend URLs are removed in this public repo. You must configure them locally to run the workflow.
